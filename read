Churn – Customer Churn Prediction Project

Churn is a machine learning project aimed at predicting **customer churn** for a telecom company using historical data. By analyzing customer behavior, the model helps identify which customers are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 📊 Dataset Used

- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn`
- Contains customer demographics, services, account information, and churn status.

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## 🧠 Models Used

- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading** from Excel file
2. **Data Cleaning** (dropping unnecessary columns, handling nulls)
3. **Label Encoding** of categorical features
4. **Train-Test Split**
5. **Model Training**
6. **Prediction & Evaluation** using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - Accuracy Score

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- Precision, Recall, F1-Score for both models
- Accuracy comparison between Random Forest and Logistic Regression

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl
